This module provides fourth step of the database generation. 
Output: SD_totalCl: the chloride ions sprayed and splashed by one truck
Input:  
        M_app: the quantity of deicing salts applied on a roadway per day during the winter season
        h_app: the thickness of melted water per day with snow melting
        SD_total: the water sprayed and splashed by one truck
Constant: 
        water_density: water density
        chloride_ratio: molar mass ratio of chloride ions over deicing salts
