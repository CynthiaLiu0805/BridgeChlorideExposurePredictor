# Contributing to This Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 🎉  
This project is maintained by a small team, so we aim to keep the contribution process simple, respectful, and lightweight.

## Ways to Contribute

Contributions of all kinds are welcome, including:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Documentation improvements
- Code contributions (bug fixes or enhancements)
- Test cases or examples

If you’re unsure whether something is in scope, feel free to open an issue to discuss it.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch from `main`.
2. Keep changes focused: one bug fix or feature per pull request is ideal.
3. Write clear commit messages that explain *why* the change was made.
4. Update documentation or comments where appropriate.

## Reporting Issues

When opening an issue, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Relevant environment details (OS, version, etc.)

Minimal reproducible examples are especially appreciated.

## Pull Requests

For pull requests:

- Reference any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #12`)
- Explain the motivation and approach in the PR description
- Keep pull requests reasonably small to make review easier
- Ensure existing tests pass (and add new tests if appropriate)

Since this is a small project, reviews may take some time—thanks for your patience.

## Coding Style

- Follow the existing coding style and conventions in the repository
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Include comments where the intent may not be obvious

`flake8` should be before submitting.

## Decision Making

As a small project:

- Maintainers make final decisions on merging pull requests
- We aim for consensus when possible
- Not all contributions may be accepted, but we strive to give clear and respectful feedback

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a **Code of Conduct** (see [CodeOfConduct.md](https://github.com/CynthiaLiu0805/BridgeChlorideExposurePredictor/blob/main/CodeOfConduct.md)).  
By participating, you agree to uphold a respectful and inclusive environment.

## Questions?

If you have questions or want feedback before starting work:

- Open an issue
- Start a draft pull request
- Ask in the project discussions (if enabled)

We’re happy to help—thanks again for your interest in contributing!
