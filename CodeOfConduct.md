# Code of Conduct

This project is maintained by a small team. We expect all contributors to:

- Treat others with respect
- Communicate professionally and constructively
- Focus criticism on ideas, not people
- Assume good faith

Harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior will not be tolerated.

If issues arise, maintainers will address them directly and proportionally,
including removing comments or contributions if necessary.
